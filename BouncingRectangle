# 1. Open a command window and change to the Python\scripts folder.
# 2. Type the command to install Arcade
# pip install arcade
# 3. Create a python program with the following code:
import arcade

SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600
RECT_WIDTH = 50
RECT_HEIGHT = 50

 # Tell the computer to call the draw command at the specified interval.

 # Run the program
