Problem descrition

Print amount of user must pay back.
    -Loan amount (Whole numbers or decimal?) OK
- check ranges(10-10,00)
Enter interest rate-either as 0.05 or 5 for 5%
check the number <1 then assume fractional interest?(Cannever have less than 1 interesr?)
    OK, inters rate > then divided by 00

    -Period of loan in years - range check on this 1 to 30

    -Compunding period?-Month or, quter, year ?? What is compounding period)


100 interesr is %10- 110 - calculated the interet once.

100 for 3 years- compounding yearly

end of year 1 = 110 = 100*10
End of year 2 = 110*10%  121
End of year 3 = 121*10% = 133.10

Enter first letter or pull first letter from string

    1. Have to design user interface
    2. have to create code to perform compounding.
        a. Quarter is 1/4 of year- 3month

Enter loan amount : XXXX
Enter interest rate: XXXXX
Enter years of loan: XXXXXXXX
Compund (Y)early, (M)onthly, (Q)uarter: XXX
You will owe us: XXXXXX
Interest

    1. Set up vaeriables
        a. loan amount = 0
        b. interest = 0.0
        c. period = 0
        d. Compounding = 0
        e. totalowened = 0
        f. Totallinterest = 0.0

    2. Prompt for data
        a. Input("Enter Loan amount"):
            i Check range - if less than 10 or > 10000
                then print errror
            ii If error go back
        b. Input (" Enter Interest Rate amount")
            i. If interst >1 then divide by 100
        c. Inpt("Ener Period of Loan")
            i. If less thean 1 or > 30 then go back to c
        d. Input("Compund (Y)early, (M)onthly, (Q)uarter: XXX")
            i. Get first letter of string
            ii. If not y or not M Or not Q then go to d

    3. Calculate compounding value
        a. If Y then period times 1
        b. I M then period X12
        c. If Q then period X 4
    4. Calculate total owed

Starting vale* interest -> New Value -> Starting V
Starting value
For each period:
StartingValue = StartingValue + ( StartingValue*interest)
